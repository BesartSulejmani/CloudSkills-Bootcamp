## Course Outline

NOTE: All sessions are recorded and available for replay. You can take your time to work through the bootcamp.

## Week 1: DevOps Fundamental Skills

Week 1 is the official kick-off of the Cloud-Native DevOps bootcamp. In week 1, you’re going to be learning all about the DevOps fundamentals. If you’re a systems administrator or infrastructure engineer breaking into the DevOps space, this is perfect for you to get a jump-start on your journey. If you’re an experienced DevOps pro, this will be a great refresher! We’ll be discussing topics such as CI/CD, source control, coding, and where the industry is heading.

- Project 1: Getting started with GitHub
- Project 2: Setting up your first Azure environment
- Project 3: Setting up your first AWS environment
- Project 4: Setting up projects in GitHub
- Project 5: Setting up your first GitHub Action

## Week 2: Scripting Like a Developer

When you’re an infrastructure pro breaking into the development and coding space, it can be intimidating. There’s a bunch of new words, definitions, and acronyms that you may not have heard before. Week 2 is to show you that it can be more simple then you think! Take the PowerShell or Python scripts you’ve written and sprinkle some DevOps best practices on them with this weeks Scripting Like A Developer lecture and labs.

- Project 1: Setting up a dev environment from start to finish
- Project 2: Reusable and clean Python code
- Project 3: Reusable and clean PowerShell code
- Project 4: Linting in PowerShell and Python
- Project 5: Testing in PowerShell and Python
- Project 6: Documenting Code

## Week 3: Infrastructure as Code

We’re always hearing about infrastructure-as-code, which is a way to define the services you create today using code. This is a great entry-point into thinking like a developer and truly automating the work that you do to not only save yourself time, but to make the outcome of your work more efficient and shareable to your peers.

- Project 1: Building an ARM template for Virtual Machine deployment in Azure
- Project 2: Building a Terraform module to create a virtual network in AWS
- Project 3: Testing infrastructure-as-code
- Project 4: Intro to Azure Bicep

## Week 4: GitHub and Source Control

Writing code and thinking like a developer is important for DevOps, but having a place to save the code you write is just as important. With platforms like GitHub and practices like source control, you can rip that code out of your documents folder and store it in a safe, secure, and shareable location so you and your team can collaborate together.

- Project 1: VS Code with Git and Github
- Project 2: Working through push conflicts
- Project 3: Contributing to an open source project

## Week 5: Continuous Integration, Continuous Deploy, and Continuous Delivery

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery is the cutting-edge way to build and ship code. You can do anything from deploy a JavaScript application to run Terraform code to build your cloud services and infrastructure. This week is all about using CI/CD in both Azure and AWS using key CI/CD platforms.

- Project 1: Deploying a C# web app via Azure DevOps
- Project 1: Building without deploying in GitHub Actions
- Project 3: Deploying Terraform via GitHub Actions
- Project 4: Setting up Continuous Monitoring
- Project 5: Artifacts and packages in CICD
- Project 6: Creating AWS CodeDeploy

## Week 6: Serverless in Azure and AWS

Serverless computing has ramped up significantly lately, for good reason. You can take an application running on IIS or Nginx and instead of having to create infrastructure to run the app, you can simply run it in a service. No more having to worry about operating system updates or management. You only have to focus on the code that’s being deployed. This week we’ll dive into what serverless can do for you.

- Project 1: Build an Azure Function app
- Project 2: Build an Azure Web App
- Project 3: Deploy an Azure Web App via CICD in GitHub Actions
- Project 4: Create a Lambda Funcion
- Project 5: Security for serverless apps
- Project 6: Monitoring Serverless Azure Apps
- Project7: Monitor Serverless AWS Apps

## Week 7: Security in Azure and AWS

Cyber security is quite possibly one of the most over-looked portions of the cloud. It’s easy to create an Azure Virtual Machine, and just as easy to accidentally give that VM that’s running Active Directory a public IP address that’s open to the world. In week 7, we’re going to dive into some key security topics in the cloud and how you can start securing your environment.

- Project 1: Securing code
- Project 2: Implementing continuous security
- Project 3: Security authentication in code
- Project 4: Creatingh IAM roles, users, and groups
- Project 5: Creating RBAC rules and Azure Policies

## Week 8: Containerization and Kubernetes

Containerized with Docker and Kubernetes is one of the most used services in the Azure and AWS ecosystem. Every organization wants to be able to go faster in an efficient, secure, and scalable manner, which is what Kubernetes gives you. This week we’ll talk about how to get Kubernetes running in Azure and AWS to ensure you’re scaling your skills at the right speed.

- Project 1: Creating a Minikube environment
- Project 2: Creating an AKS Cluster
- Project 3: Creating an EKS cluster
- Project 4: Using Azure ACI
- Project 5: Using AWS Fargate

## Week 9: Monitoring and Logging

Monitoring an application and ensuring you store logs is the difference between an application running smoothly and a 2:00 AM panic call because the application crashed. A proper monitoring and logging setup is key for any DevOps pro. This week it’s all about putting these use-cases to practice and seeing how Azure and AWS can help in your monitor and logging journey.

- Project 1: Monitoring Azure IaaS
- Project 2: Monitoring serverless platforms
- Project 3: Azure Monitor and Alerting
- Project 4: Azure logging and metrics
- Project 5: AWS CloudWatch
- Project 6: Container Monitoring with Prometheus

## Week 10: Where To Go From Here (Career Prep)

Now that we’ve taught you the skills you need to level up your success in the DevOps and development space, it’s time to talk about how you can utilize those skills to get a job or a promotion. We’re going to dive into resume updates, LinkedIn, branding yourself, and ensuring everyone that comes across your pages know you’re a DevOps pro.

- Revamping a resume
- Where to apply
- How to apply
- What to showcase (GitHub profile, LinkedIn, etc.)
- Coding interviews for Cloud Engineers
- Case Study: How to get Thousands of Follows on Twitter and LinkedIn
